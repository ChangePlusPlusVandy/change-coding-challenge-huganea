Thank you for this awesome chance to code for Change++! It was a truly enjoyable experience and I appreciate
the time and effort put in for this coding challenge.

Couple notes about the project and my experience:

- The instructions and format for the project were very straightforward. It gave enough guidelines for the user
to follow what was needed as well as show their own creativity.

- My first intuition for this project was to code it in the language I know best, Java! What a mistake, lol.
  It didn't occur to me that Java would not be the best option for the Twitter API. It required several
  different packages to be installed and gave several headaches overall.
    After a few days of research and dead ends with Java/Twitter API package, I decided to venture out into
    the unknown: Python.
    I'd always heard that Python was the preferred language of many programmers, but I never had the chance
    to test it out myself until today.
        I finally figured out how to use the Twitter API in Python.

- Some features/bugs/improvements I would like to resolve:
    Currently the API is very slow, taking its time pulling in all the data from the two users.
        Makes it hard to debug due to it needing to load every time.
        Also shows the JSON file rather than the text exclusively.
    I did not have the chance to completely filter out the Tweets with photos.
    Add an option to replay the game several times, keeping a running list of accuracy.
    ASCII of Kanye and Elon pls.
    Allowing someone to put in their own twitter handles.

    These all could be solved within 24-48 hours.

This was my first time coding in Python and using an API and I absolutely loved it!
Can't wait to see what else is in store.
